# Object-Oriented Programming in Java

## UML Diagrams

* **UML (Unified Modeling Language)** visualizes system structure.
* Class diagram elements:

  * Class name
  * Attributes (fields)
  * Methods (operations)
* Relationships:

  * Association (â†’)
  * Inheritance (â–·)
  * Composition / Aggregation
* Helps design before coding.

**Image Suggestion:** Example UML class diagram: `Car` â†’ `Engine` â†’ `Wheel`.

---

## Creating a Class in Java

* Syntax:

  ```java
  public class Car {
      String color;
      void drive() {
          System.out.println("Driving");
      }
  }
  ```
* Compile with `javac Car.java` â†’ creates `Car.class`.
* Instantiate with:

  ```java
  Car myCar = new Car();
  myCar.drive();
  ```

**Image Suggestion:** Code snippet screenshot + console output.

---

## Object in Memory

* Java objects live in **Heap memory**.
* References stored on **Stack**.
* Example:

  ```java
  Car a = new Car();
  Car b = a;
  ```

  â†’ both point to the same object.
* Managed automatically by JVM.

**Image Suggestion:** Diagram showing Stack â†’ reference â†’ Heap object.

---

## Java Memory Management

* Divided into regions:

  * **Heap:** objects.
  * **Stack:** method calls and local vars.
  * **Method Area:** class-level data.
  * **GC Heap:** garbage collector region.
* Garbage Collector runs automatically.
* No explicit `free()` or `delete` needed.

**Image Suggestion:** JVM memory layout diagram.

---

## Initializing / Loading

* **Class Loading:** JVM loads class bytecode.
* **Initialization Order:**

  1. Static blocks.
  2. Instance variables.
  3. Constructor.
* Example:

  ```java
  class Example {
      static { System.out.println("Static"); }
      Example() { System.out.println("Constructor"); }
  }
  ```

**Image Suggestion:** Flow diagram: Loading â†’ Initialization â†’ Execution.

---

## Object Destruction / Garbage Collection

* Java performs **Automatic Garbage Collection (GC)**.
* Removes unreachable objects.
* `finalize()` method (deprecated) once used for cleanup.
* Example:

  ```java
  obj = null;  // eligible for GC
  System.gc(); // suggest GC
  ```
* Developer cannot explicitly destroy objects.

**Image Suggestion:** Illustration of GC reclaiming unused objects.

---

## Parameter Passing

* **Always by Value**, even for references.
* Example:

  ```java
  void change(int x) { x = 10; }
  int num = 5;
  change(num);
  System.out.println(num); // still 5
  ```
* For objects, reference value (memory address) is copied.
* Changes inside method affect object fields, not reference itself.

**Image Suggestion:** Diagram showing primitive vs reference passing.

---

## Call by Value vs Call by Reference

| Concept   | Java              | C++                   |
| --------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Primitive | Passed by value   | By value or reference |
| Object    | Reference copied  | Can use pointers      |
| Effect    | Safe, predictable | Flexible but risky    |

**Image Suggestion:** Table-style visual comparing Java and C++ behavior.

---

## Constructor

* Special method called when an object is created.
* Has same name as the class.
* Example:

  ```java
  class Car {
      String model;
      Car(String m) {
          model = m;
      }
  }
  ```
* **Default Constructor:** provided if none defined.
* Can be **overloaded**.

**Image Suggestion:** Diagram: Object creation â†’ constructor call.

---

## this Keyword

* Refers to the **current object**.
* Commonly used to:

  * Differentiate between fields and parameters.
  * Call other constructors.
* Example:

  ```java
  class Student {
      String name;
      Student(String name) {
          this.name = name;
      }
  }
  ```

**Image Suggestion:** Visual showing `this` pointer referencing object.

---

## static Keyword

* Belongs to the **class**, not to objects.
* Shared across all instances.
* Used for:

  * Constants
  * Utility methods (e.g., `Math.pow()`)
* Example:

  ```java
  class Counter {
      static int count = 0;
      Counter() { count++; }
  }
  ```

**Image Suggestion:** Illustration of static variable shared among objects.

---

## package

* Packages group related classes.
* Syntax:

  ```java
  package com.sharif.course;
  ```
* Helps avoid name conflicts.
* Use `import` to include packages:

  ```java
  import java.util.*;
  ```
* Organizes large projects efficiently.

**Image Suggestion:** Folder tree showing com/sharif/project structure.
